Shared History AI

Summary of AI Platform

An AI platform where people can share their own or their family members' historical stories. The AI will analyze similarities between different stories and create virtual historical "fabrics" that connect people's experiences, helping to understand how different groups and generations have experienced the same events.

Background

Many historical events are viewed through a narrow lens, often told from institutional perspectives. This project aims to address the lack of personal and community-based perspectives by giving people a platform to share their own experiences.

The challenge of preserving personal stories is widespread, as many narratives are never documented or are lost over generations, especially those from marginalized groups that rarely reach official archives. Understanding history through people's stories is crucial for fostering community and recognizing shared experiences despite cultural differences. Collecting and linking these stories can help build empathy and cultural understanding, which is increasingly important in a world that often focuses on differences rather than similarities.

Data and AI Techniques

The project will collect personal stories and texts from users, including images, audio, and videos. Metadata such as location, time, or historical context will also be included. Some AI techniques used include:

Clustering and Similarity Analysis: Group stories by common themes, creating "historical fabrics" of connected narratives.

Categorization System: Automatically categorize stories based on criteria such as continent, generation, or specific historical events.

How It Is Used

The platform would be used by individuals wanting to share and preserve their stories, as well as by community organizations and museums to promote learning and a personal connection to history. The general public, researchers, educators, and marginalized groups would all be impacted. Users would contribute stories and learn from others' experiences, while historians, sociologists, and teachers could use it to explore different perspectives on historical events.

Challenges

The reliability of the stories could be an issue, as personal narratives may be subjective and not historically accurate. Gathering enough stories to create meaningful connections, especially from older generations, might also be challenging due to limited access or comfort with technology. Language barriers could hinder linking stories across languages if translations are not accurate, and NLP models might struggle with handling dialects and nuances.

Future Development

The project could integrate automatic translation to include stories in different languages, helping connect people across linguistic backgrounds. An interactive map could allow users to explore stories from various regions and understand how people in different places experienced the same historical event. Expanded AI functionality, such as deep learning, could also be used to detect more complex connections between stories and uncover hidden themes.
