# Shared History AI  

Building AI course project

## Summary

An AI-plattform where people can share their own or their family members' historical stories. The AI will be analyzing similarities between different stories and created virtual historical “Tissues” that connects peoples' experiences. Which helps understand how different groups and generations have experienced the same events. 


## Background

Many historical events are viewed through a narrow lens, often told from the perspectives of on history and social phenomenon, project aims to address the lack och personal and community-based experience on history by giving people a platform to share their own experiences.  

The issue of preserving personal stories is widespread, as many narratives are never documented or are lost over generations, especially those from marginalized groups that rarely reach official archives. Understanding history through people's stories is crucial for fostering community and recognizing shared experiences despite cultural differences.  

I am deeply motivated by the idea that personal stories can connect us in unexpected ways. Collecting and linking these stories can help us build a greater sense of empathy and cultural understanding, which is increasingly vital in a world that often highlights differences rather than similarities. 

## How is it used?

The project will collect personal stories and texts from users, including images, audio, and videos. Metadata like location, time, or historical context will also be included. Some AI-techniques that would have been used is:  

Clustering and similarity analysis could be used to group common stories by common themes and create a “historical fabric” with the connected fabrics. A Categorization system would also be implemented so that the stories can be automatically categorized based on criteria like continent, generation or even specific known events. 


The platform would be used by individuals wanting to share and preserve their own community organizations, and museums promote learning and a personal connection to history. 

## Challenges

The reliability of the stories could be an issue, as personal narratives may be subjective and not historically accurate. Gathering enough stories to create meaningful connections, especially from older generations, might also be challenging due to limited access or comfort with technology. Language barriers could hinder linking stories across languages if translations are not accurate, and NLP models might struggle with handling dialects and nuances. 

## What next?

he project could integrate automatic translation to include stories in different languages, helping connect people across linguistic backgrounds. An interactive map could allow users to explore stories from various regions and understand how people in different places experienced the same historical event. Expanded AI functionality, such as deep learning, could also be used to detect more complex connections between stories and uncover hidden themes.
